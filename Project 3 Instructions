Project 3 – Librarian’s Assistant 

The board of your public library has decided to enter the Information Age and computerize the library operations.
The goal is to have all books and library cards online, and to keep track of what books are out, etc.  
You’ve been hired to build the software to manage the library, its books, and library card holders.  

This project incorporates two main objects, books and cards:

•	Book - this class defines the data that makes up a book object and the actions a book object can take.  The data consists of:
o	A title of the book
o	Author
o	Book number
o	Whether it’s checked out or not
o	Who has the book (Card ID of the holder, 0 if checked in)

A book needs to be able to create itself (constructor), check the status, change the status when a book is checked out/in, 
check who has the book, and change who has the book


•	Card - this class defines the data that makes up a library card object and the actions a card object can take.  
The data consists of:
o	Card holder’s name
o	Card holder’s phone number
o	Card ID number
o	The book number of the book checked out (0 if none)

A card needs to be able to create itself (constructor), check any of the variables of the class, and change the book number.

Program Requirements 
The program must have a recurring main menu that reappears after every menu action is completed and must contain the following options.

1.	Show all library cards
2.	Show all books
3.	Check out a book
4.	Check in a book
5.	Create a new library card
6.	Exit the system
